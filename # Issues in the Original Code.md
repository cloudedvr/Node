# Issues in the Original Code

1. **Sequential API Calls**: The original code fetches user data sequentially, leading to longer execution times. Each `await` pauses the function, causing the next request to wait for the previous one to complete.

2. **Incorrect Order in Returned Array**: The returned array in the original code has a different order than the order of variable assignments, which can be confusing and lead to bugs.

3. **No Error Handling**: The original code lacks error handling. If any of the API calls fail, the function will fail silently, making it difficult to debug and handle errors gracefully.

4. **Hardcoded URL Strings**: URLs are hardcoded directly within the `getUsers` function, making it less flexible and harder to maintain. Extracting them into a helper function improves readability and reusability.

5. **Lack of Documentation**: The original code lacks comments and documentation, making it hard to understand the purpose and functionality of the code.

6. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: The original code mixes the logic of fetching user data with the business logic, making it less modular and harder to test. Separating these concerns into different modules improves maintainability.

7. **No Middleware Usage**: The original code does not utilize middleware for tasks like logging, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.

8. **Use of `$.getJSON`**: The original code uses `$.getJSON`, which is typically used in frontend code with jQuery. For server-side applications, it is better to use libraries like `axios` or Node's built-in `http`/`https` modules.
